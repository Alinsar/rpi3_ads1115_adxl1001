Hello. Recently I decided to get acquainted with rpi and c ++. There was a need to connect and track the values of the accelerometer ADXL1001 to rpi3 v1.2 through ads1115. The library from hallgrimur1471 (https://github.com/hallgrimur1471/Adafruit_ADS1X15_RPi) was plugged in. Tell me what to do next?
